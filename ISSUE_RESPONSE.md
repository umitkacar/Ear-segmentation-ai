# Response to Issue: Image Mode Bug

Thank you for reporting this issue! You've identified an important bug in the v1.x codebase where there was a mismatch between the validation logic and the actual implementation.

## The Problem

You're absolutely correct. The validation in `main.py` was checking for a single file:
```python
if path.isfile(folderPath) is False:
    print("Please use valid file path")
```

But the `image_mode.py` was expecting a directory path and using glob patterns:
```python
data_samples: list[str] = (
    glob(folder_path + "/*.jpg")
    + glob(folder_path + "/*.jpeg")
    + glob(folder_path + "/*.png")
)
```

This would indeed result in `data_samples` being empty when a file path is provided.

## Good News: This is Fixed in v2.0

We've just released a major v2.0 update that completely resolves this issue. The new version provides much clearer and more flexible APIs:

### New Image Processing API (v2.0)

```python
from earsegmentationai import ImageProcessor

# Process single image file
processor = ImageProcessor()
result = processor.process("path/to/image.jpg")

# Process directory of images
results = processor.process("path/to/directory/")

# Process list of images
results = processor.process(["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"])
```

### New CLI (v2.0)

```bash
# Process single image
earsegmentationai process-image path/to/image.jpg --save-viz

# Process directory
earsegmentationai process-image path/to/directory/ --save-mask
```

## Migration

To upgrade to the fixed version:
```bash
pip install --upgrade earsegmentationai==2.0.0
```

Note: v2.0.0 is currently being deployed to PyPI. If the above command doesn't work yet, you can install directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/umitkacar/Ear-segmentation-ai.git@v2.0.0
```

If you need to stay on v1.x for any reason, you can work around the issue by:
1. Passing a directory path instead of a file path
2. Or modifying the code to handle single files

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-06

### üéâ Major Release - Complete Refactor

This release represents a complete refactoring of the Ear Segmentation AI library with a modern, modular architecture while maintaining full backward compatibility with v1.x.

### ‚ú® Added

- **New Modular Architecture**
  - Separated core, preprocessing, postprocessing, API, and CLI modules
  - Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for each functionality
  - Type hints throughout the codebase for better IDE support

- **Enhanced API**
  - `ImageProcessor` class for image processing with batch support
  - `VideoProcessor` class for video/webcam processing
  - Support for processing from URLs
  - Temporal smoothing for video streams
  - Frame skipping for performance optimization

- **Improved CLI**
  - Modern CLI using Typer with rich output
  - New commands: `process-image`, `process-video`, `webcam`, `benchmark`
  - Progress bars and colored output
  - Benchmark command for performance testing

- **Configuration System**
  - Pydantic-based configuration with validation
  - YAML configuration file support
  - Environment-based configuration

- **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
  - pytest fixtures and mocking
  - 90%+ test coverage target

- **Performance Features**
  - Batch processing support
  - Model caching with singleton pattern
  - GPU memory management
  - Configurable input sizes and batch sizes

- **Developer Experience**
  - Makefile for common tasks
  - Pre-commit hooks configuration
  - Comprehensive docstrings
  - Example scripts

### üîÑ Changed

- **Project Structure**
  - Source code moved to `src/` directory
  - Modular package structure
  - Clear separation between API and CLI

- **Dependencies**
  - Updated to latest versions
  - Added pydantic for configuration
  - Added rich for better CLI output

- **Model Management**
  - Automatic model downloading
  - Better error handling
  - Support for multiple model architectures

### üõ°Ô∏è Backward Compatibility

- Full compatibility with v1.x API
- Legacy `EarModel` class available with deprecation warnings
- Old CLI commands still work (with deprecation notices)
- Migration guide included

### üìù Migration from v1.x

```python
# Old (v1.x)
from earsegmentationai import EarModel
model = EarModel()
model.download_models()
model.load_model("cuda:0")
mask, _ = model.predict(image_path)

# New (v2.0)
from earsegmentationai import ImageProcessor
processor = ImageProcessor(device="cuda:0")
result = processor.process(image_path)
mask = result.mask
```

### üêõ Fixed

- Fixed typo in parameter name (`foler_path` ‚Üí `folder_path`)
- Improved error messages and validation
- Better handling of edge cases
- Memory leaks in video processing

### üöÄ Performance

- 2-3x faster batch processing
- Reduced memory usage with better GPU management
- Optimized image preprocessing pipeline

### üìö Documentation

- Comprehensive README with examples
- API reference documentation
- Migration guide from v1.x
- Example scripts for common use cases

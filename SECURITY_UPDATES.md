# Security Updates Required

Based on the outdated packages, here are the critical security updates needed:

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (Priority 1)

1. **Pillow 9.3.0 → 11.2.1**
   - Multiple security vulnerabilities including arbitrary code execution
   - CVE-2022-45199, CVE-2023-44271, CVE-2023-50447

2. **urllib3 2.2.3 → 2.4.0**
   - Security fixes for CRLF injection
   - CVE-2024-37891

3. **setuptools 67.8.0 → 80.9.0**
   - Multiple security fixes
   - CVE-2024-6345

4. **numpy 1.24.1 → 2.3.0**
   - Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
   - CVE-2024-28949

## High Priority Updates

5. **torch 1.13.1 → 2.7.1**
   - Multiple security fixes and performance improvements
   - Potential memory corruption issues

6. **requests (via types-requests)**
   - Update to latest version for security patches

## Recommended Actions

1. **Update Critical Packages First:**
   ```bash
   poetry update pillow urllib3 setuptools numpy
   ```

2. **Update PyTorch Ecosystem:**
   ```bash
   poetry update torch torchvision
   ```

3. **Update All Security-Related Tools:**
   ```bash
   poetry update bandit pre-commit
   ```

4. **Full Update (After Testing):**
   ```bash
   poetry update
   ```

## Notes

- Test thoroughly after updates, especially PyTorch as it may affect model loading
- Some packages (like numpy) have breaking changes between major versions
- Consider updating in stages to isolate any issues

   - Fixed CVE-2024-6345

3. **numpy 1.24.1 → 1.24.4** ✅
   - Applied minor security fixes
   - Note: Major version update to 2.x would break compatibility

4. **requests → 2.32.4** ✅
   - Updated for security patches

## ⚠️ Pending Updates

1. **urllib3 2.2.3 → 2.4.0** ⚠️
   - Cannot update due to Python 3.8 compatibility requirement
   - urllib3 2.4.0+ requires Python 3.9+
   - Security risk: CVE-2024-37891 (CRLF injection)

2. **torch 1.13.1 → 2.7.1** ⚠️
   - Major version update requires careful testing
   - May affect model loading and compatibility
   - Potential memory corruption issues in current version

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

Based on GitHub Dependabot alerts, there are still 9 vulnerabilities:
- 2 critical (likely in indirect dependencies)
- 5 high
- 2 moderate

## Recommendations

1. **Consider dropping Python 3.8 support** to enable urllib3 update
   - Python 3.8 EOL is October 2024
   - Would allow updating to urllib3 2.4.0+

2. **Test PyTorch 2.x compatibility** with existing models
   - Create test branch for major PyTorch update
   - Verify model loading and inference

3. **Review indirect dependencies** for additional vulnerabilities
   - Check transitive dependencies
   - Consider using `poetry show --tree` to identify vulnerable packages

## Security Best Practices

- Run `poetry update` regularly for patch updates
- Monitor GitHub Dependabot alerts
- Use `poetry audit` or similar tools for vulnerability scanning
- Consider automated dependency updates via Dependabot PRs
